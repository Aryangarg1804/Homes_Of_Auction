                    <p>
                        At Homes of Auction, our mission is to transform the way people buy and sell real estate by leveraging the power of technology. We strive to create a transparent, efficient, and secure platform where properties are auctioned in real-time—giving equal opportunity to all buyers and maximizing value for sellers. By combining advanced search features, detailed listings, and a user-friendly experience, we aim to simplify the property transaction journey and bring trust and innovation to every deal.

                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        The journey of Homes of Auction began with a simple question: Why is buying or selling property still so complicated? Born out of a passion for innovation and a desire to solve real-world problems, we set out to create a smarter, more transparent way to handle real estate transactions.
                        <br><br>
                        What started as an idea soon evolved into a platform that empowers users to take control of property deals through real-time bidding, detailed insights, and secure digital processes. Along the way, we’ve listened to users, learned from challenges, and continued to evolve with one clear goal—making property transactions seamless, trustworthy, and accessible to everyone.

                        I’m a second-semester Computer Science Engineering student at Chitkara University.
                        I’ve always been curious about how websites work, and that’s what got me into coding.
                        Now, I genuinely enjoy building things that people can actually use and interact with.
                        <br><br>

                        I’m pretty solid with front-end development — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my go-to tools.
                        I love creating clean, responsive designs and adding small details that make a site feel smooth.<br><br>
                        Lately, I’ve been exploring more advanced stuff to level up my projects even further.
